## User Input

```text
$PATH_TO_MIGRATION_FILES
```

First ask the user for the full absolute path to the folder that contains the migration files for the Postgres database!!

In $PATH_TO_MIGRATION_FILES you find the complete DB schema (build up by migrations). Only the files ending with .up.sql are relevant. The files ending on .down.sql can be ignored.
	  
Please use these migration files to understand the DB schema. Do you have suggestions to improve it?
Please add the suggestions to a makrdown called $PATH_TO_MIGRATION_FILES/DBSchemaImprovements.md.
When writing the suggestions please rate them by severity and effort.
	  
Please add a info on top of the file with the information: Warning: "This document was created by AI model <your model name> at <timestapm of now in format YYYY-MM-DD>. Please do not edit!".

Add below that info a collapsed text box with the title "Used Prompt..." and content. "The file was generated by the agent defined at: <relative path to the agent file in this repo>"
